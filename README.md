# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns 
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends 
### Outline of the project
    The purpose of this analysis is to assist Louise in determining the best time of year for her to launch a campaign and what a realistic funding goal could look like for her to bring her idea to life. Taking the data that Louise had compiled on various other plays and their success rates and funding goals, we were able to run separate analysis with Excel functions that Louise needs to determine the best course of action for her play. 
    By filtering the data Louise had compiled, we were able to create separate pivot tables and line graphs that depict a plays success rate based on the time of year its campaign was held and a line graph that depicts how successful a play was based on their campaign goal. These graphs are what will help Louise see how her play’s campaign date and funding goal fared in relation to various other plays.  
### Analysis and Challenges 
  ## Theatre Outcomes Based on Launch Date
  To perform the first analysis, determining the success of a play based on its launch date, we began by extracting data from the main Kickstarter worksheet and bringing the data from the necessary columns to a separate worksheet. The data that we needed to run this analysis included the years column, the parent category, which we used an Excel filter on the narrow it down to theatre, and column “F” of the Kickstarter data sheet, which determined whether a play was successful, failed, or canceled. This data was then entered into a pivot table, which we then used to create a line graph.

  When creating the pivot table, it is critical to make sure you are entering the data in the correct fields. This includes making sure you are filtering the data on the correct categories, the parent category and years, and placing the outcomes, date created, and the count of outcomes values in the correct field. This will ensure the correct data falls on the x and y axis to display an accurate line graph of the data we are aiming to depict. This was initially a challenge for me. I have no prior experience with pivot tables so it took some trial and error to place the data in the correct pivot table fields. After successfully creating the pivot table and line graph, I was able to see why the data categories are placed in their respective fields and how to format the tables to generate the outcomes I was looking for.   
## Outcomes Based on Goals
    When performing the analysis for the “Outcomes Based on Goals” data, I encountered a formula I had never used in Excel before, the COUNTIFS function. At first, this function proved to be a challenge for me but after analyzing the criteria I was entering, I realized that the function needed more criteria then what I was entering. Figuring this out allowed me to successfully complete the table and populate the number successful, failed, and canceled columns based on the goal parameters set in column “A.” After completing the worksheet and populating the remained of the columns with the percentage values, I was able to see how making a mistake in the COUNTIFS functions can populate incorrect values for the rest of the sheet. This speaks on the necessary attention to detail needed when working with Excel functions because all of the data relies on previously entered values. 
    After completing the table, I was then able to create a line graph to depict the percentage successful based on the goal range, which yielded the graph below.

### Results
    # What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date?
        After performing the analysis on the theatre outcomes by launch date data, it appears that the most successful campaigns occurred between the months of May through July. The beginning and ending months of the year appear to have the least success. The months May through July also saw the highest number of failed campaigns, along with October.
    # What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
       	By analyzing the “Outcomes Based on Goals” line graph, we can see that as the goal of the campaign begins to increase, the percentage of successful pays begins to decrease. As the plays begin to ask for more money, the percentage failed starts to climb. There is, however, an uptick in the percentage successful when the goal range is 35000-40000. The range with the greatest number of successful plays is the 1000-4999 range. However, this is not the range with the highest percentage successful. This is because that category also has the highest number of failed campaigns, and this decrease in the percentage successful can  be seen in the blue line on the line graph. 
    # What are some limitations of this dataset?
       	Limitations of the data set may include the sample size that we are working with. Although there are many plays that Louise gathered to analyze, there are still many more plays in other countries occurring or some that Louise may have missed that could provide further insight on the data. In the “Outcomes Based on Goals” table, a limitation is that the data is self-determined and relied on the accuracy of the function that we entered. If we entered anything incorrectly, it will yield an incorrect value and then this value will be used to fill out the rest of the table. Incorrect values in this case will produce an incorrect line graph, which we need to analyze the results. 
    # What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
        Another potential analysis run on the Kickstarter data set could be to look at the correlation of the deadline of the campaign. With this analysis we could determine if the length of the campaign has an effect on whether it reached its goal or on how many backers the campaign received given the time frame.
