# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns 
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends 
## Outline of the project
    a.	The purpose of this analysis is to assist Louise in determining the best time of year for her to launch a campaign and what a realistic funding goal could look like for her to bring her idea to life. Taking the data that Louise had compiled on various other plays and their success rates and funding goals, we were able to run separate analysis with Excel functions that Louise needs to determine the best course of action for her play. 
    By filtering the data Louise had compiled, we were able to create separate pivot tables and line graphs that depict a plays success rate based on the time of year its campaign was held and a line graph that depicts how successful a play was based on their campaign goal. These graphs are what will help Louise see how her playâ€™s campaign date and funding goal fared in relation to various other plays.
