# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns 
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends 
### Outline of the project
    The purpose of this analysis is to assist Louise in determining the best time of year for her to launch a campaign and what a realistic funding goal could look like for her to bring her idea to life. Taking the data that Louise had compiled on various other plays and their success rates and funding goals, we were able to run separate analysis with Excel functions that Louise needs to determine the best course of action for her play. 
    By filtering the data Louise had compiled, we were able to create separate pivot tables and line graphs that depict a plays success rate based on the time of year its campaign was held and a line graph that depicts how successful a play was based on their campaign goal. These graphs are what will help Louise see how her play’s campaign date and funding goal fared in relation to various other plays.  
### Analysis and Challenges 
  ##Theatre Outcomes Based on Launch Date
   	To perform the first analysis, determining the success of a play based on its launch date, we began by extracting data from the main Kickstarter worksheet and bringing the data from the necessary columns to a separate worksheet. The data that we needed to run this analysis included the years column, the parent category, which we used an Excel filter on the narrow it down to theatre, and column “F” of the Kickstarter data sheet, which determined whether a play was successful, failed, or canceled. This data was then entered into a pivot table, which we then used to create a line graph.
